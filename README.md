# Modeling-And-Simulation
This is an implementation of some the fundamental concepts of simulation and modeling, that includes concepts such as queuing theory and forecasting.
It demonstrates the ability of 

This GitHub repository contains a modeling and simulation project that uses queuing theory and forecasting to analyze and optimize complex systems. 

Queuing theory is a mathematical framework used to study the behavior of waiting lines or queues.
while forecasting involves making predictions about future events based on historical data. 

Together, these techniques can be applied to a wide range of applications, including transportation systems, healthcare, manufacturing, and telecommunications.

The project involves developing a simulation model that captures the behavior of a queuing system, specifically a bank waiting line that contains ordinary
and distinguished customers. 

The model takes into account factors such as arrival rates, service times, queue lengths, and resource utilization. 
Using queuing theory, the model can be analyzed to determine key performance metrics such as queue length, waiting time, and service level.

In addition to queuing theory, the project also incorporates forecasting techniques to predict future demand and resource requirements. 
This involves analyzing historical data to identify patterns and trends, and using this information to make predictions about future demand. in our case it was a newspaper seller.

The project is implemented in Python, and includes code for data preprocessing, model development, simulation, and analysis. 

Overall, this queuing theory and forecasting modeling and simulation project is a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding and optimizing complex systems.
It provides a practical demonstration of queuing theory and forecasting techniques, and can be adapted to a wide range of applications and industries.
